Description: Package Discovery and Resource Access using pkg_resources
 The pkg_resources module provides an API for Python libraries to
 access their resource files, and for extensible applications and
 frameworks to automatically discover plugins.  It also provides
 runtime support for using C extensions that are inside zipfile-format
 eggs, support for merging packages that have separately-distributed
 modules or subpackages, and APIs for managing Python's current
 "working set" of active packages.

Description: Wietse Venema's TCP wrapper utilities
 Wietse Venema's network logger, also known as TCPD or LOG_TCP.
 .
 These programs log the client host name of incoming telnet,
 ftp, rsh, rlogin, finger etc. requests.
 .
 Security options are:
  - access control per host, domain and/or service;
  - detection of host name spoofing or host address spoofing;
  - booby traps to implement an early-warning system.

Description: Bean Scripting Framework to support scripting languages in Java
 Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
 scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
 objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write JSPs in
 languages other than Java while providing access to the Java class library. In
 addition, BSF permits any Java application to be implemented in part (or
 dynamically extended) by a language that is embedded within it. This is
 achieved by providing an API that permits calling scripting language engines
 from within Java, as well as an object registry that exposes Java objects to
 these scripting language engines.
 .
 BSF supports these scripting languages:
  * Python (using Jython)
  * JavaScript (using rhino)
  * XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and Xerces)
  * BeanShell (using bsh) via its own bsf adapter
 .
 Support for Tcl, NetRexx is not available in this Debian
 package since Jacl, NetRexx (non-free) are not packaged.

Description: GNU dbm database routines (runtime version)
 GNU dbm ('gdbm') is a library of database functions that use extendible
 hashing and works similarly to the standard UNIX 'dbm' functions.
 .
 The basic use of 'gdbm' is to store key/data pairs in a data file, thus
 providing a persistent version of the 'dictionary' Abstract Data Type
 ('hash' to perl programmers).

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.
